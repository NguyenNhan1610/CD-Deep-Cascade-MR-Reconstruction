# CD-Deep-Cascade-MR-Reconstruction

This repository investigates the usage of Cascades of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction.
We will look into:

- Advantages of Data Consistency (DC) layers; 
- Cascades of flat un-rolled structures and cascades of U-nets;
- Cross domain cascades (k-space and image domains);
- Different sampling pattern distributions;
- Potential advantages of including adversarial components;
